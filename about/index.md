I'm Josh Ferriday, I'm on a journey through web development. This blog is about what I'm learning and working on.

## Currently Learning
### React
I've been getting my hands dirty in React recently, following Codecademy's excellent React course.
### CSS
It's been a while since I first learned CSS. I'm working on using Bootstrap to style sites.
