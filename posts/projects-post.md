I've been building projects to supplement what I'm learning on both the JAMStack bootcamp and Codecademy full stack courses.
A couple of the projects I've been building were ready to show, so I thought I'd practise my Netlify and GitHub Pages deployment skills and get them online.

[Spare My Food](https://jferriday.github.io/spare-my-food/) is my first attempt at using external APIs. I made this shortly after learning about promises and HTTP requests in JavaScript. It uses the [Give Food](https://givefood.org.uk/) API to list foodbanks nearby, their contact details and items they need.

[Selecta](https://selecta.netlify.app/) is a new project, made since I've been learning about React. It's based on a Codedacemy project named 'Jamming', which forms part of their React course. The original version of this project was made using class components. The application allows a user to log in with their Spotify account, search for tracks and add them to a playlist. They can then save the playlist and it'll appear in their account. I decided to build the project from scratch again, using functional components and hooks instead. It was great fun to build and really helped me familiarise myself with building using React, making API requests and working with JSON data from an external source.

I will be adding to these projects and improving them. So there is more to come! Checkout the 'Projects' page for future updates. It generates nicely-formatted cards for each project based on a 'projects' JSON object using Nunjucks and some Bootstrap CSS. Pretty neat stuff :)
